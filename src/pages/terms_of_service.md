# Terms of Service for RideNote

**Last Updated: January 22, 2026**

## Agreement to Terms

By downloading and using RideNote ("the App"), you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you don't agree, please don't use the App.

These Terms are between you and Nasif [Last Name] ("we," "us," or "our"), the developer of RideNote.

## What RideNote Is

RideNote is a personal utility app that helps mountain bikers track their bike settings and remember what worked on different trails. It runs entirely on your device with no cloud services or user accounts.

## What You Can Do

You're allowed to:
- Use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes
- Track unlimited bikes and ride setups
- Create custom checklists
- Add photos from your camera roll
- Use the App offline without internet connection
- Back up the App's data through your device's backup system (iCloud, iTunes)

## What You Can't Do

You may not:
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the App
- Remove or modify any copyright notices or branding
- Redistribute, sell, or sublicense the App
- Use the App for any illegal purposes
- Attempt to extract the App's source code
- Use the App in any way that violates these Terms

## Your Content

**You own everything you create in RideNote:**
- Bike information and photos
- Ride setups and notes
- Checklist items
- Any other data you enter

By using RideNote, you grant us NO rights to your content. We don't collect it, we don't store it on our servers, and we never see it. It stays on your device.

**Your Responsibility:**
You're responsible for:
- Backing up your data (through device backups)
- The accuracy of information you enter
- Not entering anyone else's private information
- Any consequences of using setup information you logged

## No Warranties

RideNote is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind.

**We don't guarantee:**
- The App will be error-free or uninterrupted
- Data won't be lost or corrupted (back up your device!)
- The App will meet your specific needs
- Results you get from using setup information you tracked

**Use at Your Own Risk:**
RideNote is a personal tracking tool, not a professional suspension tuning service. We're not responsible for:
- Bike damage from settings you choose
- Injuries from riding with tracked settings
- Data loss if you don't back up your device
- Any other consequences of using the App

**Important:** Always consult your bike's manual for recommended pressure ranges and suspension settings. RideNote helps you track what you try—it doesn't tell you what's safe or optimal for your bike.

## No Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, we're not liable for:
- Data loss or corruption
- Device damage
- Personal injury related to bike settings
- Any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages
- Loss of profits, data, or business opportunities

**Maximum Liability:** Our total liability is limited to the amount you paid for the App (if applicable) or $50, whichever is less.

## Limitation of Liability

You understand and agree that:
- Mountain biking is inherently dangerous
- Incorrect suspension or tire pressure settings can affect bike handling
- You're solely responsible for checking that settings are safe for your bike
- RideNote is a tracking tool, not a recommendation engine
- We provide no advice about what settings to use

## App Store Terms

If you downloaded RideNote from the Apple App Store:
- Apple is not responsible for the App or these Terms
- Apple has no obligation to provide support or maintenance
- Apple is not liable for any claims related to the App
- These Terms are between you and us, not Apple

You also agree to comply with Apple's App Store Terms of Service.

## Updates and Changes

**App Updates:**
We may release updates to:
- Fix bugs
- Add features
- Improve performance
- Maintain compatibility with new iOS versions

Updates are optional but recommended. You can control updates through your device settings.

**Terms Updates:**
We may update these Terms. If we make significant changes:
- We'll update the "Last Updated" date
- We'll notify you in the App
- Continued use after changes means you accept the new Terms

## Account and Payment (Future)

**Current Version:** RideNote currently has no user accounts, subscriptions, or in-app purchases. If we add these in the future:
- They will be completely optional
- The core app will remain functional without payment
- We'll update these Terms before launching
- Apple will process all payments (not us)

## Termination

**You can stop using RideNote anytime by:**
- Deleting the App from your device
- This immediately removes all your data

**We can terminate your access if:**
- You violate these Terms
- You use the App for illegal purposes
- Required by law

Since there are no accounts, "termination" simply means you agree to delete the App and stop using it.

## No Support Obligation

We're not required to provide:
- Technical support
- Bug fixes
- Feature updates
- Ongoing maintenance

That said, we do care about making RideNote useful. If you find bugs or have feedback:
- Email: support@ridenote.co.za
- We'll do our best to respond, but can't guarantee support

## Intellectual Property

**We Own:**
- The RideNote name, logo, and branding
- The App's design, code, and features
- Any original content we created

**You Own:**
- All data you enter into the App
- Photos you add from your camera roll
- Notes and checklists you create

## Dispute Resolution

**Governing Law:**
These Terms are governed by the laws of South Africa, regardless of where you use the App.

**Disputes:**
If we have a dispute, we'll try to resolve it informally first. Contact us at support@ridenote.co.za before taking legal action.

**Arbitration:**
Any disputes that can't be resolved informally will be settled through binding arbitration in South Africa, except where prohibited by law.

## Severability

If any part of these Terms is found invalid or unenforceable, the rest remains in effect.

## Entire Agreement

These Terms, along with our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding RideNote.

## No Waiver

Our failure to enforce any part of these Terms doesn't waive our right to enforce it later.
